          DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).

        <p>
          It aims to shorten the system development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

        <p>
          DevOps focuses on automating the process of software integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It fosters a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking down silos and promoting faster and more reliable software releases.
        </p>
